Part 1 :
All the test cases are in tests folder. To run the Sudoku Solver you need to add the path of the test file
in place of FileName as written in the code(also in #comment).
The number in test file denotes the value of k for sudoku.
The expected output files(if solution exists) are also present in the test folder.

Part 2:
Just run the python file with pysat installed and enter the value of k.

For both the parts Output will be produced in a file named as "output_sudoku_pair.csv",which will be 
generated once you run the program and ouput will also be printed in the terminal.
